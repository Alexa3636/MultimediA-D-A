		Insomnia is one of the most common mental health issues around the world. According to statistics, 30% of the world has it,
		and the numbers are constantly increasing. One of the reasons that people develop this issue can be rooted in how modern society
		lives. (Rapid lifestyle, increased information production and consumption, increased screen time, constant stressing on something, etc.)
		Also, considering relaxation time, people tend to bombard their minds with visual imagery that is all around us in modern society and
		displayed by our digital gadgets. Even before going to sleep, people use their phones to get ready for bed, which is not the best way to
		put their minds at ease. However, our digital gadgets can also be used differently, which could affect our minds in a calming way through
		sound.</p>

		<p>And now, let’s examine a real-life scenario to support the idea!</p>
		<p>Emily Smith, 29, is an ordinary woman. However, she runs around like a headless chicken most days because of her tight schedule. 
		Her life involves University, a part-time job in a restaurant, studying for her free time and a lot of caffeine. She had hobbies and
		a colourful social life before, but she put that on hold in order to achieve her goals. GET OUT OF CATERING! and score a proper 9-5 
		job that perhaps she will enjoy, too. That could mean no more dealing with idiotic customers, 12-14 hours shift without food, drink 
		or breaks when she is available, and no more running for minimum wage! The ultimate dream! However, even though she is busy with her 
		studies, she still needs this job as money is tight, and she needs to support herself. So, she only has closing shifts when she works. 
		It means finishing up around 23.00 and getting home around midnight when she finally gets some food, can sit down, watch something on TV, 
		shower, and finally go to bed around 2.00. Then suddenly, her thoughts go back to that nasty table where the guy was complaining about 
		the slow service and put on quite a show to get some discount on his table. “Yeah, because that was a great idea to come into a packed 
		restaurant when you have 20 minutes before your movie starts….ahhh, honestly…where will humanity go without logic?” then some thoughts 
		pop into her mind about school “Today’s lecture was amazing, it was a shame I could not concentrate after 20 min. ….I was so sleepy…
		Ohh and I need to remember to check out the application for Summer school……” and it goes on and on and on. After one hour of being 
		unable to turn her mind off, she gives up and starts to play on her phone, and the time goes on until she finally falls asleep around 5 am. 
		Her alarm goes off at 8 am, and the running starts again.</p>
		<p>However, nights with trouble sleeping more often occur as time passes, affecting her life badly. She can’t wake up in time, 
		so she misses her first lecture constantly, or she dozes off on them. She is also always tired, irritated, and unable to focus properly. 
		THIS CAN NOT GO ON! She does some research, so she already has a name for the issue; it is called insomnia, and it can be treated 
		by cognitive behavioural therapy or medication, which is not exactly appealing to her. Hence, she tries to figure out more….</p>
		<p>One day, she comes across an eye-catching website that offers an informative insight into the aspect of insomnia and also offers 
		some alternative solutions to handle the issue. It piques her interest, so she stays on to browse further. She only scans through 
		the information about insomnia as she already did her own research about it; however, she clicks on some of the links that take her to 
		the original academic publications that were used as references. “Ohh nice, I also found this one!” Then she watches one of the videos 
		on the site with a neuroscientist who talks about troubled sleeping as a societal issue and the importance of good sleeping. 
		“Yeah, I know we should sleep more…I should definitely sleep more, but how?” Then she finds some statistics that show the screening habits
		of contemporary people and remembers her research and the video she watched that spending time in front of the screen before bed can affect
		sleeping badly. “It is shocking…Well, actually thinking about it, I am one of them, and I am doing it right now….I am in the bed, 
		on my phone….at least I am doing it today for a good cause!” Then she reaches the part emphasising that sound can be used to put the 
		mind at ease and how easy it is to access different types of sounds and recordings through our digital gadgets. She goes for the first 
		option, audiobooks. “Nice, these videos are fascinating, and there are options to try it out…uhh, it is very late already… let’s go for 
		it…I can’t lose anything.” She puts on a children’s story that she used to listen to as a child, as she had it on cassette. 
		She is listening to it, focusing on the story that helps her let go of her horrible day, and the narrator’s calm voice helps her relax 
		and finally sleep. The next day, it works again, like magic. The day after, she finds a fascinating audiobook, however, the story is too 
		interesting, so she can’t fall asleep with it, so she goes back to the website and tries a different approach. “OK next is relaxing music…. 
		why not”. She goes for one of the suggested authors on the website and goes for one of the albums. “Piano with rain and forest birds sounds….
		It sounds good.” Next morning, she could only recall the album’s first two tracks.</p>
		<p>Emily tries out most of the staff offered by the website; some works for her amazingly, and some is simply not for her. Occasionally, 
		she needs to change from one method to another, depending on her mood and mindset. However, after she had an awful day in school and work, 
		when she gets to bed, she just can’t let go of her day and turn off her mind about it. She goes back to the website; maybe 
		she missed something. “No…I tried out everything….” Then something catches her eye: a forum. She starts to read the posted messages 
		and is amazed at how many people live like her with similar issues. She decides to write something, too, and after finishing and posting, 
		she feels better. Collecting her thoughts and writing it down helped her to let it go. “I think I am ready to sleep now!”</p>
