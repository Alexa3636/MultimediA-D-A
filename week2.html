		<h1>Week 2: Familiarizing myself with my target audience & thinking about appropriate design(s).</h1>
		
		<section id="IL-week2">
		<h2>A. Independent Learning</h2>
		<h3>Defining your Audience</h3>
		<h4>Tasks 1 - Identifying your audience(s)</h4>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Age:</b></li>
			<dd>The primary target audience will be teenagers, adults, and older groups who can recognize the issue 
			<br>and do the appropriate research on it.However, in some way, the younger audience needs to be considered
			<br>as a passive audience because there is a possibility that parents will do the research and, therefore, 
			<br>come across the website to find solutions for their children's problematic sleep.</dd>
		<li><b>Gender:</b></li>
			<dd>Not specified.</dd>
		<li><b>Language proficiency:</b></li>
			<dd>English</dd>
		<li><b>Educational level:</b></li>
			<dd>Basic literacy of computer use, besides reading and decoding skills, will be necessary to navigate the 
			<br>website and find it. Therefore, potential users do not need any specific educational background. 
			<br>The website will provide links to scientific research data for users with academic backgrounds; however, 
			<br>the used academic publications and references will be summarised and “translated” into an easily digestible 
			<br>form for the primary users on the main website.  </dd>
		<li><b>Attitude towards writer or organisation:</b></li>
			<dd>Several academic research studies examined the idea of the different digital audio formats, such as audiobooks, 
			<br>podcasts, or music (meditative), their positive effects on sleeping quality, and their use as a possible alternative 
			<br>solution for insomnia. However, as with every alternative solution for a significant issue, the opinions differ in 
			<br>their effectiveness.</dd>
		<li><b>Knowledge of the topic:</b></li>
			<dd>o	Already using it as an alternative solution for insomnia – recurring browser</dd>
			<dd>o	Sceptic about it – never tried it but heard about it / trust in medication.</dd>
			<dd>o	Information seeker - Still in the dark – Does not have a name for the life-changing issue or just got introduced to the aspect of insomnia.</dd>
		<li><b>Audience action:</b></li>
			<dd>The website will focus on three digital audio types, audiobooks, podcasts and music, as an alternative solution for a 
			<br>common mental health issue: insomnia. The preferable outcome is that through interaction and the provided information, 
			<br>users will find an understanding of their mental health issue (insomnia) and preferably find an efficient alternative solution 
			<br>for this problem by introducing them to the benefits of the mentioned digital audio types and providing ways to try them out. 
			<br>Also, the website will provide interaction among different users in some way (e.g., forum) to enhance information flow and 
			<br>create opportunities to present feedback or new ideas for each other from first-hand experiences.</dd>
		</ul>
		<h4>Task 2 - Building audience personas</h4>

		<h4>Task 3 - Exploring the audience needs in relation to design</h4>
		<p><dd>The overall design will focus on creating a peaceful and harmonious interface for the users in consideration of the website's main purpose, 
		<br>which is to provide understanding and preferably some relief for them about their or their loved one's mental health issue. For instance, 
		<br>it will be reflected through the offered alternatives (audiobook, boadcast, music) that will be presented to invite the users to try them out 
		<br>in order to find the most efficient one for their needs. Also, the proposed forum function of the website could contribute to creating a converging community 
		<br>that enhances the website's content and supports individuals to open towards the community. The design and the chosen colour scheme (night sky) will create 
		<br>a calming interface associated with the topic. The presented multimedia elements will be varied to inform and interact with the users and 
		<br>also provide emotional connections and responses. Creating a straightforward navigation system will also be focused on, considering the broad target audience 
		<br>and the contingent state of some potential users (lack of sleep – hardship in focusing and slow responses).</dd></p>
