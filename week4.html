		<h1>Is Listening To Podcasts As We Fall Asleep Bad For Our Brains?</h1>
		<h2>Paragraph one:</h2>
		<p>"It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it happened but at some point in the last five years, the way I fall asleep changed. 
		Instead of reading before turning off the lights or just staring at the ceiling in the dark 
		like a haunted Victorian widow, I started a nightly routine of untangling my headphones and 
		listening to a podcast. The pod itself varies: right now it's Threedom, a podcast where 
		three comedians chat absolute nonsense, but it could be anything as long as it’s engaging 
		and entertaining. I’ll listen until I realise I have no idea what I just heard, then 
		half-heartedly pull my earbuds out while pressing the pause button before drifting off."</p>
		<h2>Paragraph three:</h2>
		<p>"Falling asleep to podcasts, in and of itself, is not novel. There is limited research 
		about podcast-listening habits but according to 2019 data from Edison Research, more than 
		half of the nearly 6,000 people surveyed in the US say that listening to podcasts is a way 
		they relax before falling asleep. Even more compelling is the number of sleep podcasts and 
		audiobooks available: go into any podcatcher app, search ‘sleep’ and you’ll end up scrolling
		through a wealth of titles. This is to say nothing of the boom in apps like the mindfulness 
		app Calm and audiobook provider Audible, which have thrived off sleep stories and 
		soundscapes."</p>
		<h2>Paragraph five:</h2>
		<p>"According to Dr Lindsay Browning, a chartered psychologist, author of Navigating Sleeplessness 
		and founder of Trouble Sleeping, listening to podcasts can be a useful habit, especially if you 
		struggle with anxiety or falling asleep. "Podcasts can be helpful to distract someone from their 
		busy mind in the short term, as they give you something to think about that is not the subject that
		is on your mind." However, she adds that it is not unequivocally a good habit. "When people start to get 
		into a habit of not sleeping, and they start to become anxious about their sleeping problems, 
		listening to something in bed can actually make things worse," Lindsay tells R29. "Your brain 
		can start being kept awake by actively listening to the podcast instead of sleeping, plus the 
		noise of the podcast can wake you up once you drift off.""<p>
		<h2>Paragraph six:</h2>
		<p>"This is why sleep podcasts and sleep stories are designed the way they are, she says. 
		"Sleep stories (of which some are ASMR, or autonomous sensory meridian response, based) are 
		designed to be stories with little content but rather soothing sounds and describing gentle scenery 
		designed to relax you as you fall asleep." The stories are deliberately made to be as uninteresting 
		and non-engaging as possible so that you do not try to stay awake to listen to them."</p>
