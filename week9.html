		<p>These accessibility tools are undoubtedly useful and highlight the issues around the aspect of making websites accessible to everyone. 
		I was surprised about the used webpage and how many red flags it got on WAVE for contrast errors; at first glance, it looked nicely designed
		to create a simple, smooth, elegant, and calming atmosphere for the viewer. However, after visualising the issues, I started to examine the 
		webpage from another perspective. Indeed, it has very low contrast considering the backgrounds and presented text elements that could be
		hard to interpret visually. The contrast issues were highlighted further when I used WebAim, although the bottom third of the background 
		passed the test providing a nice contrast for the foreground but also made it complicated to read the text. (background fixed picture). 
		Also, I could not figure out the colour codes from the code so as an alternative solution I used GIMP’s colour picker tool after taking
		a screenshot from the webpage. It provided me with the HTML notation.  Link (orange) and text (grey) colours have a nice saturation contrast
		however, the link colour does not correspond well to the background colour (white - foreground). This webpage could be problematic to
		interpret for individuals with visual disability. </p>
		<p>WAVE also highlighted missing alternative text for images which I could not figure out as there are only YouTube videos imbedded on 
		this page and I could not find the icons for it either.</p>
		<p>The result of the readability test is appropriate considering the content of the webpage. (from teenage years onward).</p>
		<p>As for my portfolio, I am aiming for good contrast and readability. I also came up with the idea of changing the style for day and 
		night users. (Week 6). Alternative text for images is also important to provide usable information for audio narration. Every image in 
		the portfolio has alternative text however I am planning to give them more descriptive text for the final website.  Also, I will focus 
		on providing subtitles and captions for the video elements.</p>

		<dd><p>(Crickets chirping) 
			<br>(Owl hooting) 
			<br>(A car passing by) 
			<br>(Relaxing music playing)<br><br>

			The night has come, and the moon shines brightly. This is the time when people are supposed to all be settled already in their beds and have
			 drifted off to “dreamland”. Only the nocturnal animals are wide awake, owls, foxes and crickets awake, but this is their time of the day.<br> 
			<br>Although she is not an owl, a fox, or a cricket Lucy is wide awake in her bed, unable to sleep. She is changing channel after channel
			 on the TV with tired eyes and mind. “This isn’t going to help; I should try something else to relax.” she thinks.<br> 
			<br>She puts her headphones on.<br> 
			<br>She yawns tiredly. The music takes her mind off of her troubles, and she is finally able to relax. She feels her mind drifting 
			further and further away…<br> 
			<br>She arrives in “dreamland” and is having a beautiful dream…

		<center>
		<video id="VD07w8-driftingoff-med" height="400" controls>
		<source src="VD07w8-driftingoff-med.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		<track src="subtitle_cc.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English" default>
		
		</video>
		</center>
		

			<p>
			It does not want to work! I tried to solve it, but it is time to put it on hold until next semester.
			When I did not add the default attribute for the track line, the button appeared, and when I clicked on it, nothing happened, and it disappeared. (W3school presented the code that way, so I tried it.)
			When I used the provided code, nothing happened.
			Everything was in the same folder, I looked for mistakes in the code (nothing). I saved the vtt file with the correct extension for All files....
			I checked different websites for other codes to solve the issue, but all presented the same thing we used.
			I will upload two screenshots to prove I was working on it, but I can not find the issue. I was following the instructions provided by the websites.

			<p>
			As for accessibility, I was thinking about an obvious one. People use different kinds of devices to browse the Internet. 
			The different sizes of screens could alter the website’s interface; therefore, it needs to be responsive. It enhances the user experience 
			on every device.
			<br>Considering my proposed website, I will use video elements, so subtitles and captions will be integrated. This option can be enhanced 
			further by adding subtitles in different languages. This way, the website could widen the range of the target audience.
			<br>For images, alternative text will be added in a descriptive way to aid audio narration. Further, the colours on the website will 
			be carefully considered to provide appropriate contrast.
