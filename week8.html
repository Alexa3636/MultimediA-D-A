		<h2>A. Independent Learning</h2>
		<h3>Analysing Digital Video</h3>
		<h4>Task 1: Analyse the use of video on the web:</h4>
		<p><b>A. https://www.superlativa.it/</b></p>
		<dd><p><a href="https://www.superlativa.it/">Explore the website!</a></p></dd>
		<p>The video at the beginning of the page was used to emphasise the website's message 
		("Traceable carbon negative and zero waste: The New Opulence"). It also provides an emotional parallel for the audience by representing 
		the ocean. (It was created from five shorter videos.) There are no other video elements on the page. Also, the presented video does not
		interact with typographical elements but corresponds to the overall design of the latter visual elements. Animations were also used on 
		the page to display the elements throughout the whole page. (For me, it was a bit too much and distracted my attention when I scanned 
		through the page for the first time. Also, I was faster than the animation most of the time, so I was seeing a blank page when I was 
		scrolling down.) The length is suitable to provide some motion for the interface.</p>
		<p><b>B. https://alightinthewoods.net/books</b></p>
		<dd><p><a href="https://alightinthewoods.net/books">Explore the website!</a></p></dd>
		<dd><p><b>SLOW TV</b></p></dd>
		<dd><p><a href="https://alightinthewoods.net/slow-tv">Explore the website!</a></p></dd>
		<p>It is a lovely site. The whole site is designed as a kind of story exploration through visual elements, animation and textual 
		instructions for the flow of the story and to reveal its background. The design creates a whole circle and is very eye-catching. 
		There is a video element that also depicts a story by constantly changing and recreating itself for the viewer, like a real-time drawing 
		of the elements. It provides relaxation time if someone wants to rest during exploration. (Slow TV). The TV page's design corresponds to 
		the overall website's design. It is a long video but can be exited anytime by the “explorers”, no need to watch it along for the primary 
		exploration of the storylines it does not provide any additional information, only to enchant the visual senses of the audience. 
		Appropriate relaxing music was also added to the video.</p>
		
		<h4>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of video content:</h4>

		<video height="1000" controls>

		<p>This software is quite useful. I already edited the video on a basic level but creating something entirely new with a different 
		meaning was a unique experience for me. Figuring out how the software works was a bit time-consuming, especially when it came to the
		animation of text or emojis. Also, I had to be careful when I was positioning the different elements on the track because I could mix 
		up something easily (especially, when I was layering them.). This is a delicate software that requires patience. The preview window was 
		extremely good to reassess the advancement of the video and to try out the features of the software.</p>
		
		<p>Considering my video. I was trying to build up a story around my chosen topic with a simple narrative (beginner in video editing) 
		but preferably an eye-catching and emotional output. In my opinion, these features are very important in a video to have a well-created 
		background or base story and to connect to the audience on some kind of emotional level which could excite them, make them happy or sad etc.
		Also, it needs to be edited to keep the constant attention of the audience but give them enough time to assess the information in the video. 
		(Finding the balance is essential!) </p>
		
		<p>About the different quality savings of my video, the low was highly degraded in quality. Even if the size of the file was very low 
		(6.03MB) I would never use it on a website. I could see moving the pixels as the video was playing and the images were changing. The medium 
		quality produced an optimal video (60.08MB). It was good to watch with clear output and would be acceptable to post on a website. 
		High quality had even better visual quality, but the size of the file is much bigger as well (180MB). In this case, it is still alright 
		as the video itself is less than two minutes but it definitely needs to be considered in vaster video elements to not affect the user 
		experience badly.</p>
