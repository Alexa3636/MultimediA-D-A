		<h3>Analysing Digital Audio</h3>
	    <h4>Task 1: Analyse the use of audio on the web. </h4>

		<p>For my proposed website, audio elements will be the key to providing interactivity for the visitors and supporting the ideological 
		background of the website’s main message through that interaction.<br> 
		I used Internet Archive or YouTube to get my audio elements. (For YouTube, I used different converter tools to download them in mp4 or mp3 
		formats.)<br><br> 
		Internet Archive has a massive collection of downloadable audiobooks for free as it is in the public domain. This website does not apply 
		any additional sound effects such as background music or ambient sounds. Here, sounds are represented in a very specific role to correspond 
		to the webpage’s purpose.<br><br>
		YouTube’s collection includes many audio materials in video format. Even under the music section, audio materials are supported with 
		background images. Luckily, there are useful tools to convert the videos, not mp3 formats. (Creative Commons)</p>		
		 
		 
		 <h4>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of audio content. </h4>

		<h2>B. Lab works</h2>
		<h3>Editing digital audio</h3>
		
		
		<h4>Task 1: Optimise your audio for Web use:</h4>
		
		<p><b><u>Relaxing Music Example - "Dan Gibson's Solitudes" / in three versions: </u></b></p>
		<center>
		<p><b>A. Medium - Mono:</b></p>
		<audio controls>
		<source src="AD06w7-MusicExample-DG-Solitudes-medium-mono.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		<p><b>B. Medium - Stereo:</b></p>
		<audio controls>
		<source src="AD07w7-MusicExample-DG-Solitudes-medium-stereo.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		<p><b>C. Standard - Stereo:</b></p>
		<audio controls>
		<source src="AD08w7-MusicExample-DG-Solitudes-standard-stereo.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		</center>
		
		<p>Considering the different saved formats, mp3 is compressed; therefore size wise it is more suitable for application on a website. 
		Also, the stereo format provides richer sound; mono was duller compared to them. Also, the standard version had better quality. 
		It showed more distinctively on the music audio materials "Relaxing music", which was used for the task and got attached to the portfolio. 
		However, I used the audiobook example file for the second part. Also, I would highlight that headphone was needed to hear clearly the 
		differences.</p>
		
		<h4>Task 2: Exploring alternative options:</h4>
		
		<p>As for familiarising myself with Audacity, I simply tried solving one of the issues I noticed on the Audiobook file. 
		There was a distinctive background noise that I successfully removed. I do not have much previous experience with this software; 
		therefore, I looked for some external help on how to do it. I have found a useful tutorial about it, and by getting a noise sample, 
		the software isolated the background noise. Then, by using noise reduction with the constant application of the preview function 
		to figure out the appropriate settings, I could clear the audio. (It will be beneficial knowledge for the next semester if I encounter 
		similar issues.)</p>
