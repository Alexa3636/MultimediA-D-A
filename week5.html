		<h3>Review Professional Writing Characteristics</h3>
		
		<h4>Task 1 & 2: Review professional writing characteristics & Evaluate resources</h4>
		<p>For this task, I chose a mainly text-based website to analyse. It is an article, “Audiobooks: The Past, Present, and Future of 
		Another Way to Read”. At first glance, the page follows the standards of the online published article pages. It is centrally arranged and
		has enough white space in it to be easily readable. Also, it uses pop-up texts approximately at every quarter of the main body of the text 
		that are highlighted by size and colouring when the reader’s attention would slip away. There is only a heading picture, so the focus is 
		mainly on the text as a visual element and its content.</p>
		
		<dd><p><a href="https://lithub.com/audiobooks-the-past-present-and-future-of-another-way-to-read/">Explore the website!</a></p></dd>
		
		<ul>
		<li><b>ACCURACY</b> – It looks accurate considering its style visually and in writing. The presented credentials of the author also support the 
		accuracy. However, no references or links to supportive materials about the article's content are given at the end.</li>
		<li><b>ACTIVE VOICE</b> – Present in the author's own voice and shared experiences and quotations from other persons. "I"</li>
		<li><b>LIMIT BIASES</b>– I could not discover any.</li>
		<li><b>CLARITY</b>– It was clear in style and wording.</li>
		<li><b>CONCISENESS</b>– The text's body is split after every 4-8 rows, which is efficient to help keep the reader's attention.</li>
		<li><b>CONVERSATIONAL AND SMOOTHLY FLOWING PROSE</b>– The used language is easily digestible. Contractions are used.</li>
		<li><b>CORRECTNESS</b>– As far as I can tell, it looks correct (Unfortunately, not native English). Also, it was written by a professional; 
		therefore, it should be correct…</li>
		<li><b>PARALLELISM</b>– Used. "The librarian on duty handed me a heavy cassette player I'd need for their half-speed, four-track tapes along with 
		a green carton containing East of Eden, which we'd be reading in senior English."</li>
		<li><b>POSITIVE VOICE</b>–  I did not come across words with negative connotations.</li>
		<li><b>STRONG NOUNS AND VERBS</b>– Well-used. There is no exaggerated adjective used in the text, only the right amount to emphasize something.</li>
		<li><b>SENTENCE VARIETY</b>– Used. "An introduction to a collection of Jack London short stories I checked out said he published more than 70 books. My library had fewer than a dozen."</li>
		<li><b>SIMPLE WORDS</b>– Used. "The National Library Service shorted for NLS , FBI, email."</li>
		<li><b>SHORTER PARAGRAPHS</b>– Longest: 8 rows – shortest: 4 rows – good balance and practice.</li>
		<li><b>TONE AND VOICE</b>– It informs the reader, balancing between facts and the stories created by the author's active voice. Therefore, it is like a journey for the reader that provides information and 
		emotional connection.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Task 3: The Awe writing process.</h4>
		<p>Considering my weekly task that has already been executed, I would say the potential audience circle is well-outlined, and the purpose 
		of the website is clear. The research is ongoing according to the further advancement of the idea and experience in web design and will 
		probably continue until the final submission. The basic structure for organising information has been figured out but will likely be 
		fine-tuned as time passes. Also, it will be finalised after processing the used materials to provide information on the final website.</p>

		<h2>B. Lab works</h2>
		
		<h3>Adapting textual content to your design needs</h3>
		
		<h4>Task 1: Using Voyant-tools to explore textual content.</h4>
		
		<p>Word clouds are useful visual elements that catch the audience's attention and visually summarise the content of the text, presentation, 
		etc. Considering the content of the chosen webpage', the words presented seem accurate; however, I am surprised about the hierarchy, which 
		would get a different arrangement for the proposed website with audiobooks in the centre. The hierarchy calculated by the frequent words 
		section probably affects the word cloud's creation.The Summary provides valuable details as well about how readable a text is. The 
		vocabulary density can indicate the occurrence of unique words, that is, in this case, on the lower side. Also, it has an average of 22.1 
		words in the sentences, which is a good number. The displayed data shows that the text is well-readable.The trends and bubbliness tools also 
		correspond to the frequency of different terms in the text. They nicely visualise it according to the calculated numbers, which is perfect 
		for text analysis and could show what the content of the text focuses on.</p>

		<h4>Task 2: Create samples of text.</h4>
		
		<p><b>A.Week3 – IL. – 1st paragraph.</b>
		<br><br>

		“Insomnia is one of the most common mental health issues around the world. According to statistics, 30% of the world has it, and 
		the numbers are constantly increasing. One of the reasons that people develop this issue can be rooted in how modern society lives. 
		(Rapid lifestyle, increased information production and consumption, increased screen time, constant stressing on something, etc.) 
		Also, considering relaxation time, people tend to bombard their minds with visual imagery that is all around us in modern society and displayed 
		by our digital gadgets. Even before going to sleep, people use their phones to get ready for bed, which is not the best way to put their minds 
		at ease. However, our digital gadgets can also be used differently, which could affect our minds in a calming way through sound.”

		<p><b>B. A more personal approach.</b>
		<br><br>
		Dear explorer,<br><br>
			If you read these lines, it could mean that you are sleepless, maybe for the first time or maybe for more than one occasion. Well, if that is the case, then you are in the right place. This website offers you some alternative approaches to overcome your sleeplessness in a way that helps you relax and just <b>LET IT GO</b>. Hopefully, one of the presented ideas will be able to clear your mind and help you drift off into your well-deserved rest. 
			You can try out three different approaches: audiobooks, sleeping podcasts or relaxing music presented on the website. Keep in mind that every person is different, and every person needs different things to be able to relax. <b>FIND THE RIGHT ONE THAT WORKS FOR YOU!</b>
			As for my last words, I wish you a good night and I hope you will find here what you are looking for.
			<br><br>Yours sincerely,
			<br><br>“The creator”</p>
